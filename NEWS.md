# TemporalHazard 0.9.6

## New features

* **`weights` now supported for all distributions** — Phase 4e of the
  development plan lands. The exponential, log-logistic, and
  log-normal likelihoods and their analytic gradients now apply row
  weights to every censoring term (event, right-censored,
  left-censored, interval-censored). The 0.9.5 guard in `hazard()`
  that rejected `weights` for `dist %in% c("exponential",
  "loglogistic", "lognormal")` has been removed. Fits with integer
  weights reproduce the row-duplicated fit to optimizer tolerance
  across all five distributions.
* **Conservation of Events now honours weights.**
  `.hzr_conserve_events()` and `.hzr_select_fixmu_phase()` take an
  optional `weights` argument; the multiphase optimizer threads it
  through so per-phase cumulative hazards are summed on the same
  scale as the (weighted) observed event count. CoE no longer
  auto-disables when weights are non-uniform — the dimension
  reduction stays on and the MLE matches the full-dim path.

# TemporalHazard 0.9.5

## New features

* **Stepwise covariate selection** — `hzr_stepwise()` runs forward,
  backward, or two-way stepwise selection on an existing `hazard` fit
  using Wald p-values or AIC deltas as the entry / retention criterion.
  Phase-specific entry is supported for multiphase models: a covariate
  can enter one phase and not another. Defaults match SAS `PROC HAZARD`
  (`SLENTRY = 0.30`, `SLSTAY = 0.20`); AIC mode uses `ΔAIC < 0`
  uniformly. SAS-style `MOVE` oscillation guard freezes variables that
  enter + exit more than `max_move` times. Returns an object of class
  `c("hzr_stepwise", "hazard")` with a `$steps` selection trace, scope
  record, and elapsed timer. Implements the core algorithm from C
  HAZARD `stepw.c` / `backw.c`.

## Bug fixes

* **Multiphase convergence after weights/repeating-events merge** —
  restored multiphase optimization that regressed in 0.9.4: three
  interacting defects in the new `weights` threading (dup-arg
  collision in the multiphase / Weibull closures, positional-arg
  corruption in every distribution's gradient call) made every
  optimizer iteration error silently inside `tryCatch`. Diagnosed and
  fixed via commit 73b4657.
* **Weibull analytic gradient now applies `weights`** — both
  `.hzr_gradient_weibull()` and the `grad_internal` closure inside
  `.hzr_optim_weibull()` accepted `weights` as a formal but did not
  apply it to the score vector. The optimizer still converged via
  line search on the (weighted) log-likelihood, but the gradient
  direction was wrong and the final gradient norm did not go to
  zero. Both gradient paths now weight the event indicator and
  cumulative hazard building blocks. Fits with integer weights
  reproduce the equivalent row-duplicated fit to optimizer tolerance.

## Scope change

* `weights` is now only accepted for `dist = "weibull"` and
  `dist = "multiphase"`. The 0.9.4 NEWS claimed weights were
  threaded through all distribution-specific likelihoods; in fact the
  exponential, log-logistic, and log-normal single-distribution paths
  accepted the formal but never applied it, so the fit was silently
  unweighted. `hazard()` now raises an explicit error when `weights`
  is supplied with one of those distributions rather than returning
  an unweighted fit. Full support for the remaining single-dist paths
  is tracked in `inst/dev/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` Phase 4e.
* **Conservation of Events is auto-disabled when weights are not
  all 1.** `.hzr_conserve_events()` receives the weighted event count
  as its target but sums per-phase cumulative hazards across rows
  *without* applying weights, so Turner's adjustment comes out on a
  mismatched scale. The multiphase optimizer now detects non-unit
  weights and skips the CoE dimension reduction, falling through to
  the (correctly weighted) full-dimensional path. Fits are still
  correct; they just don't benefit from the one-parameter
  analytical closed-form solve. Weighted CoE wire-up is tracked
  alongside the other weights completion work in
  `inst/dev/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` Phase 4e.
* **Repeating-events / counting-process notation narrowed.**
  `Surv(start, stop, event)` with `start > 0` is no longer accepted
  by `hazard()`. The 0.9.4 NEWS claimed each epoch contributed
  `H(stop) - H(start)` to the likelihood, but downstream likelihoods
  only read `time_lower` for interval-censored rows (`status == 2`);
  counting-process rows (`status` in `{0, 1}`) were silently scored
  with `H(stop)` alone, so any fit with nonzero entry times was
  silently wrong. `hazard()` now raises an explicit error. The
  trivial case `Surv(0, t, d)` -- equivalent to `Surv(t, d)` --
  continues to work. Full wire-up of `H(stop) - H(start)` for all
  distribution paths is tracked in
  `inst/dev/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` Phase 4f.

# TemporalHazard 0.9.4

## New features

* **Observation weights** — `weights` argument in `hazard()` applies Fisher
  weighting to the log-likelihood for `dist = "weibull"` and
  `dist = "multiphase"`. Each observation's contribution is multiplied
  by its weight, enabling severity-weighted event analyses. Implements
  the SAS `WEIGHT` statement. _The original 0.9.4 entry claimed
  coverage of all distribution paths; the 0.9.5 patch corrected the
  claim and fixed a gradient wire-up bug in the Weibull path._
* **Repeating events** — `Surv(start, stop, event)` start-stop notation
  is parsed. _The original 0.9.4 entry claimed each epoch contributed
  `H(stop) - H(start)` to the likelihood, but the downstream
  likelihoods never applied the lower bound for counting-process rows;
  the 0.9.5 patch narrowed the feature to the trivial `start = 0`
  case and added an explicit error for nonzero starts._

# TemporalHazard 0.9.3

## New features

* `hzr_deciles()` — Decile-of-risk calibration function comparing observed
  vs. expected event counts across risk groups with chi-square GOF testing.
  Implements the SAS `deciles.hazard.sas` macro workflow.
* `hzr_gof()` — Goodness-of-fit function comparing parametric predictions
  against nonparametric (Kaplan-Meier) estimates with observed vs. expected
  event counting. Implements the SAS `hazplot.sas` macro workflow.
* `hzr_kaplan()` — Kaplan-Meier survival estimator with logit-transformed
  confidence limits that respect the [0, 1] boundary, interval hazard rate,
  density, and restricted mean survival time (life integral). Implements the
  SAS `kaplan.sas` macro output structure.
* `hzr_calibrate()` — Variable calibration function for assessing functional
  form before model entry. Groups a continuous covariate into quantile bins
  and applies logit, Gompertz, or Cox link transforms. Supports
  stratification via the `by` parameter. Implements the SAS `logit.sas` and
  `logitgr.sas` macros.
* `hzr_nelson()` — Wayne Nelson cumulative hazard estimator with lognormal
  confidence limits. Supports weighted events for severity-adjusted repeated
  event analyses. Implements the SAS `nelsonl.sas` macro.
* `hzr_bootstrap()` — Bootstrap resampling for hazard model coefficients with
  bagging support (fractional sampling). Returns per-replicate estimates and
  summary statistics (mean, SD, percentile CI). Implements the SAS
  `bootstrap.hazard.sas` macro workflow.
* `hzr_competing_risks()` — Competing risks cumulative incidence using the
  Aalen-Johansen estimator with Greenwood variance. Handles any number of
  competing event types. Implements the SAS `markov.sas` macro.
* **Conservation of Events (CoE)** — Turner's theorem is now integrated into
  the multiphase optimizer. One phase's log_mu scaling parameter is solved
  analytically at each iteration, reducing the optimization dimension by 1
  and improving numerical stability and convergence. Enabled by default;
  disable with `control = list(conserve = FALSE)`. Implements the core
  algorithm from C HAZARD `setcoe.c` / `consrv.c`.
* New vignette: "Complete Clinical Analysis Walkthrough" — end-to-end
  workflow from Kaplan-Meier baseline through validated multivariable model,
  mirroring the SAS HAZARD analytical sequence.

## Improvements

* Multi-start optimizer now respects user-set RNG seeds for reproducibility
  (removed `set.seed(NULL)` that was actively breaking determinism).
* Vignette metadata normalized to YAML `vignette:` key across all 8 files.
* `fit` parameter documentation corrected to state default is FALSE.
* README now includes key capabilities table and development plan link.

# TemporalHazard 0.9.1

## New features

* G3 late-phase decomposition (`hzr_phase("g3", ...)`) now fully integrated
  into the multiphase optimizer, Hessian, and prediction pipeline.
* `fixed = "shapes"` parameter in `hzr_phase()` allows fixing shape parameters
  during estimation (matching C/SAS HAZARD workflow of estimating only log-mu
  scale parameters).

## Bug fixes

* `summary.hazard()` now correctly reports standard errors when some
  parameters are fixed. Previously, `anyNA(vcov)` rejected the entire
  variance-covariance matrix when fixed parameters had NA entries.
* `print.summary.hazard()` coefficient table now shows the correct label
  for G3 phases (was printing empty parentheses).
* `print.summary.hazard()` phase listing now uses the phase name in
  CDF labels (e.g., "cdf (late risk)") instead of hardcoded "early risk".
* SAS missing value markers (`.`) in CSV datasets are now handled via
  `na.strings = c("NA", ".")` in `data-raw/make_data.R`, preventing
  numeric columns from being read as character.

## Documentation

* Seven Quarto vignettes: getting-started, fitting-hazard-models,
  prediction-visualization, inference-diagnostics, mathematical-foundations,
  package-architecture, and sas-to-r-migration.
* Roxygen examples now include both single-phase and multiphase models.
* README switched to self-contained CABGKUL examples with G3 late phase.
* Dataset axis labels corrected to "Months" (not "Years").

## Infrastructure

* CI workflows updated to use `roxygen2::load_pkgload` for lazy data
  compatibility.
* Added lintr CI workflow with `.lintr` configuration.
* pkgdown action bumped to `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
* Added `use-public-rspm: true` to all CI workflows.
* Added `lintr` to Suggests.
