# Jacobian of multiphase cumulative-hazard predictions

Only `cumulative_hazard` and `survival` are delegated here – `hazard`
and `linear_predictor` are rejected upstream for multiphase models.

## Usage

``` r
.hzr_predict_jacobian_multiphase(
  theta,
  time,
  phases,
  covariate_counts,
  x_list,
  p,
  per_phase = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- theta:

  MLE parameter vector.

- time:

  Prediction times (length n).

- phases:

  Named list of `hzr_phase` objects.

- covariate_counts:

  Named integer vector.

- x_list:

  Named list of per-phase design matrices.

- p:

  Length of theta.

- per_phase:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, return a named list of per-phase `n x p` Jacobians
  (each with only that phase's columns nonzero) instead of their sum.

## Value

Numeric `n x p` Jacobian of `H(t|x)` (default), or a named list of
per-phase `n x p` Jacobians when `per_phase = TRUE`.
