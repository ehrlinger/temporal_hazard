# Calibrate a continuous variable against an outcome

Group a continuous covariate into quantile bins, compute the event
probability (or hazard rate) per bin, and apply a link transform (logit,
Gompertz, or Cox). This is the R equivalent of the SAS `logit.sas` and
`logitgr.sas` macros.

## Usage

``` r
hzr_calibrate(
  x,
  event,
  groups = 10L,
  by = NULL,
  link = c("logit", "gompertz", "cox"),
  time = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Numeric vector: the continuous covariate to calibrate.

- event:

  Numeric vector: event indicator (1 = event, 0 = no event).

- groups:

  Integer: number of quantile bins (default 10).

- by:

  Optional factor or character vector for stratified calibration (SAS
  `logitgr.sas` functionality). If provided, calibration is computed
  within each stratum. Default `NULL` (no stratification).

- link:

  Character: transform to apply to event probabilities. One of `"logit"`
  (default), `"gompertz"` (complementary log-log), or `"cox"`.

- time:

  Optional numeric vector: follow-up time, required when `link = "cox"`.
  The Cox link computes \\\log(\text{events} / \sum \text{time})\\
  (constant hazard rate).

## Value

A data frame with one row per group (or per group-by-stratum
combination) and columns:

- group:

  Integer group label.

- by:

  Stratum level (only present when `by` is provided).

- n:

  Number of observations in the group.

- events:

  Number of events.

- mean:

  Mean of `x` within the group.

- min:

  Minimum of `x` within the group.

- max:

  Maximum of `x` within the group.

- prob:

  Event probability (events / n), or for Cox link: events / sum(time).

- link_value:

  Transformed probability on the chosen link scale.

## Details

Use this function before model entry to assess whether a covariate's
relationship with the outcome is approximately linear on the link scale.
If the transformed probabilities are roughly linear against the group
means, the covariate can enter the model untransformed. Curvature
suggests a transformation (log, quadratic) may improve fit.

avc <- na.omit(avc)

# Logit calibration of age
cal <- hzr_calibrate(avc$age, avc$dead, groups = 10)
print(cal)
