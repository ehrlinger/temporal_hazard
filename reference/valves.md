# Valves: Primary Heart Valve Replacement

Data for 1,533 patients who underwent primary heart valve replacement.
The largest multivariable example dataset with multiple endpoints
including death, prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), bioprosthesis
degeneration, and reoperation.

## Usage

``` r
valves
```

## Format

A data frame with 1533 rows and 19 variables:

- age_cop:

  Age at operation (years)

- nyha:

  NYHA functional class (1–4)

- mitral:

  Mitral valve position indicator (0/1)

- double\_:

  Double valve replacement indicator (0/1)

- ao_pinc:

  Aortic position, incompetence (0/1)

- black:

  Black race indicator (0/1)

- i_path:

  Ischemic pathology indicator (0/1)

- nve:

  Native valve endocarditis indicator (0/1)

- mechvalv:

  Mechanical valve indicator (0/1)

- male:

  Male sex indicator (0/1)

- int_dead:

  Follow-up interval to death or last contact (months)

- dead:

  Death indicator (1 = dead, 0 = censored)

- int_pve:

  Follow-up interval to PVE or last contact (months)

- pve:

  PVE indicator (1 = PVE, 0 = censored)

- bio:

  Bioprosthesis indicator (0/1)

- int_rdg:

  Follow-up interval to degeneration or last contact (months)

- reop_dg:

  Reoperation for degeneration indicator (0/1)

- int_reop:

## Examples

``` r
data(valves)
valves_cc <- na.omit(valves)

# Kaplan-Meier for two endpoints
km_death <- survival::survfit(
  survival::Surv(int_dead, dead) ~ 1, data = valves_cc)
km_pve <- survival::survfit(
  survival::Surv(int_pve, pve) ~ 1, data = valves_cc)

plot(km_death, xlab = "Months after valve replacement", ylab = "Survival",
     main = "Valves: Death and PVE endpoints")
lines(km_pve, col = "red")
legend("bottomleft", c("Death", "PVE"), col = c("black", "red"), lty = 1)
