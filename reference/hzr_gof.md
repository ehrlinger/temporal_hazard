# Goodness-of-fit: observed vs. predicted events

Compare a fitted hazard model against the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier
estimate by computing observed and expected (parametric) event counts at
each distinct event time. This is the R equivalent of the SAS
`hazplot.sas` macro and implements the conservation-of-events
diagnostic.

## Usage

``` r
hzr_gof(object, time_grid = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A fitted `hazard` object (with `fit = TRUE`).

- time_grid:

  Optional numeric vector of time points at which to evaluate the
  parametric model. If `NULL` (default), uses the sorted unique event
  times from the fitted data.

## Value

A data frame with one row per time point and columns:

- time:

  Evaluation time.

- n_risk:

  Number at risk (Kaplan-Meier).

- n_event:

  Number of events at this time.

- n_censor:

  Number censored at this time.

- km_surv:

  Kaplan-Meier survival estimate.

- km_cumhaz:

  Kaplan-Meier cumulative hazard (\\-\log(\text{km\\surv})\\).

- par_surv:

  Parametric survival from the fitted model.

- par_cumhaz:

  Parametric cumulative hazard.

- cum_observed:

  Cumulative observed events to this time.

- cum_expected:

  Cumulative expected events (sum of individual cumulative hazards for
  observations exiting the risk set).

- residual:

  Expected minus observed (`cum_expected - cum_observed`).

For multiphase models, additional columns are appended for each phase:
`par_cumhaz_<phase>`.

An attribute `"summary"` is attached with scalar diagnostics: total
observed events, total expected events, and the final residual.

## Details

At each observed event time the function computes:

- The Kaplan-Meier survival and cumulative hazard.

- The parametric survival and cumulative hazard from the fitted model
  (and per-phase components for multiphase models).

- Cumulative observed events vs. cumulative expected events (sum of
  individual cumulative hazards for those exiting the risk set at each
  time).

- The running residual (expected minus observed).

Perfect model fit implies the expected and observed event counts track
each other (residual near zero). This is the conservation-of-events
principle.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
data(avc)
avc <- na.omit(avc)
fit <- hazard(
  survival::Surv(int_dead, dead) ~ age + mal,
  data  = avc,
  dist  = "weibull",
  theta = c(mu = 0.01, nu = 0.5, beta_age = 0, beta_mal = 0),
  fit   = TRUE
)
gof <- hzr_gof(fit)
print(gof)
