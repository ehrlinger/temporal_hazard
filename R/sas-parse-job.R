# sas-parse-job.R -- map SAS censoring statements onto this package's status
# coding. Later job-translation tasks add to this file.
#
# This package codes censoring -1 left, 0 right, 1 event, 2 interval.
# survival::Surv() uses DIFFERENT integers for the same meanings under
# type = "interval" (0/1/2/3 for right/event/left/interval). Carrying one
# coding into the other is a wrong answer with no error, and this package has
# already shipped exactly that bug once (Surv(type = "left") read
# left-censored rows as right-censored). Never mix the two vocabularies.

#' Translate SAS censoring statements to this package's status coding.
#'
#' Builds an unevaluated `status` expression -- and, where needed, a
#' `time_lower` expression -- from the `EVENT`/`ICENSOR`/`LCENSOR`/`RCENSOR`
#' operands of a `PROC HAZARD` statements list, ready to drop into a
#' `hazard()` call.
#'
#' **`LCENSOR` is left-*truncation*, not left-censoring.** Its operand is the
#' counting-process *entry time* -- all four corpus uses are literally
#' `LCENSOR STARTTME`, paired with `TIME INT_TE` (see
#' `inst/dev/FIXTURE-GAP-LIST.md`, answered Q1). It never changes `status`:
#' HAZARD has no left-censoring in this package's sense, so `status = -1` is
#' never produced by this translator. A future reader must not "restore" an
#' `LCENSOR` -> `-1` branch.
#'
#' **`ICENSOR`'s first operand is an event *count* (OBS column 4, `C3`), not a
#' 0/1 flag.** Its grammar (`src/hazard/hazard_y.y`) is
#' `ICENSOR c3var '=' ctimevar;`, and the likelihood in `setlik.c` uses a
#' Nelson-type approximation `C3 * ln([CF(T) - CF(CT)] / (T - CT))`, so a row
#' is interval-censored where `C3 > 0`. The second operand (`CTIME`) is the
#' interval's *lower* bound -- the interval runs `CTIME` -> `TIME` (see
#' `FIXTURE-GAP-LIST.md` Q1). `EVENT` is optional: the reference `HAZARD`
#' program (`src/hazard/varterm.c`) terminates only when *both* `EVENT` and
#' `ICENSOR` are missing, so a job that specifies `ICENSOR` alone is
#' legitimate. In that case the base status is right-censored (`0`)
#' everywhere, overridden to `2` where `C3 > 0`. A job specifying neither is
#' rejected with an error, mirroring HAZARD's own termination.
#'
#' **`EVENT`, `ICENSOR` and `WEIGHT` are all counts**, and `setlik.c` combines
#' them for one OBS record as `c1c2c3 = c1w + c2 + c3w` (with `c1w = C1 * WT`
#' and `c3w = C3 * WT`), then
#' `llike = -(c1c2c3) * (CH(T) - CH(ST)) + c1w * log h(T) + c3w * lct`. That
#' decomposes into at most three independent contributions, each of which
#' [hazard()] expresses as one row's status and weight:
#' * `C1 > 0` -- an event row of weight `C1 * WT` (status `1`);
#' * `C2 > 0` -- a right-censored row of weight `C2` (status `0`);
#' * `C3 > 0` -- an interval row of weight `C3 * WT` (status `2`).
#'
#' `C2` is the one **not** multiplied by `WT`, and that is not an oversight in
#' the reference: `readc2.c` sets `C2 = ONE` on exactly the rows where neither
#' `C1` nor `C3` fires, so SAS weights a right-censored row `1` whatever the
#' `WEIGHT` variable says. Emitting a bare `WT` there instead over- or
#' under-weights every censored row -- and a `WEIGHT` that happens to be `0`
#' on censored rows deletes them from the fit outright, silently (#158).
#'
#' So `weights_expr` is emitted whenever `EVENT` or `ICENSOR` is present --
#' which is always, since a job with neither is rejected -- as
#' `ifelse(EVENT > 0, EVENT * WT, ifelse(C3 > 0, C3 * WT, 1))`, dropping
#' whichever branches the job does not have and dropping `* WT` when there is
#' no `WEIGHT` statement. For the 0/1 `EVENT` and absent `WEIGHT` that most
#' jobs carry this evaluates to exactly the unit weights those jobs already
#' fitted with; it is the repeat-event and weighted rows that change.
#'
#' `status` therefore derives from `EVENT > 0`, never from `EVENT` itself
#' (#157). This package codes status `-1` left, `0` right, `1` event, `2`
#' interval, so a row recording two events (`EVENT = 2`) mapped straight onto
#' `status` becomes *interval-censored* -- a different likelihood branch, not
#' an under-count -- and `EVENT = 3` lands outside the coding altogether,
#' which also disables Conservation of Events (`coe_supported_data`).
#' `readc1.c` accepts any `C1 >= 0` and keeps a fractional count (`notintg`
#' only raises a report flag), so `> 0` is the right test and a fractional
#' count carries through as a fractional weight. A *negative* count SAS
#' deletes (`c1del`, `del = 1`) and a *missing* one likewise (`mc1del`,
#' `mdel = 1`); `readobs.c` then skips `setobs()` and subtracts the row from
#' `Nobs`, so it contributes nothing at all -- it is emphatically not a
#' right-censored row of weight 1. This translator has no way to drop a row,
#' and dropping one silently would change `n` behind the reader's back, so the
#' hoisted status chunk opens with a guard per named count that stops and
#' names the variable, the SAS rule and the remedy (filter the rows out).
#'
#' **A row where `EVENT` and `ICENSOR` both fire is refused at fit time.**
#' `setlik.c` *sums* the two contributions, so such a row is simultaneously an
#' event of weight `C1 * WT` and an interval observation of weight `C3 * WT`;
#' [hazard()] carries one status and one weight per row and cannot express
#' both. Whether any row does this is a property of the *data*, not of the job
#' text, so it cannot be refused at translation time the way `LCENSOR` +
#' `ICENSOR` is; instead the hoisted status chunk opens with a guard that
#' stops before the fit and names the by-hand remedy (split the row in two).
#' Picking the event branch and discarding `c3w` -- what this translator did
#' before -- converges and reports plausibly, which is the shape this package
#' exists to refuse. The same guard covers `EVENT` + `RCENSOR` and `ICENSOR`
#' + `RCENSOR`; see the `RCENSOR` paragraph below.
#'
#' **`RCENSOR` names `C2` itself** (`hazard_y.y`:
#' `rcensorstmt : RCENSOR NAME { setvar(13,$2); }`; `rcnsprc.c` sets `c2name`
#' from statement field 13), and `C2` is likewise a *count* --
#' "COUNT OF CENSORED INDIVIDUALS AT TIME=T" in `setlik.c`'s header, and
#' `OBS(3)`, "NUMBER OF CENSORED OBSERVATIONS AT T". The two branches of
#' `readc2.c` are what decides the translation: when `c2name` is non-blank
#' `C2` is read straight from the data, and the `C2 = ONE` derivation is
#' skipped *entirely*; only a blank `c2name` derives it. So the censored
#' branch of `weights_expr` is the literal `1` for a job with no `RCENSOR`
#' and the `C2` variable itself for a job with one (#162), and it is never
#' multiplied by `WT` either way. Four censored individuals fitted as one
#' observation is the same under-weighting as #154/#157, arriving by the
#' third of the three counts.
#'
#' No corpus job exercises it: `hz.te123.OMC.sas` and `hz.tm123.OMC.sas` are
#' the only two of the 110 with an `RCENSOR` statement, and both set a 0/1
#' `CENSORED` that is mutually exclusive with `EVENT`, for which `C2` and the
#' derived `1` agree on every row. That is why it went unseen, not evidence
#' that it does not bite.
#'
#' Three edge cases follow from reading `C2` verbatim, and none is silent.
#' `readobs.c`'s all-zero deletion is narrower than it first looks: both of
#' its rules are guarded by a blank-name test, `ic10 && ic20` only when
#' `c3name` is blank and `ic30 && ic20` only when `c1name` is blank. So a row
#' with every count zero is deleted for `EVENT` + `RCENSOR` and for `ICENSOR`
#' + `RCENSOR`, and *kept* -- contributing `c1c2c3 = 0` -- when all three are
#' named. There is no such rule at all for `EVENT` + `ICENSOR`, which is
#' exactly the pairing with no `c2name`. This translator has no way to drop a
#' row, so an all-zero row arrives with weight `0`: no contribution to the
#' likelihood, which is what deletion means for the fit and what the
#' all-three case does anyway, though the row still counts toward `n`.
#' A *negative* `C2` SAS deletes (`c2del`) and a *missing* one it deletes too
#' (`mc2del`) -- the same rule `readc1.c` and `readc3.c` apply to their own
#' counts, guarded only by the name being non-blank -- so both are caught by
#' the missing/negative guard above rather than by [hazard()]'s incidental
#' "non-negative and finite" check.
#'
#' **A row where two named counts both fire is refused at fit time.** With
#' `RCENSOR` present this is no longer only the `EVENT` + `ICENSOR` pair:
#' `readobs.c` deletes a row only when *both* of a pair are zero, so
#' `C1 > 0 & C2 > 0` and `C3 > 0 & C2 > 0` reach `setlik.c` too and are
#' summed there. Each such row is two observations at once -- an event of
#' weight `C1 * WT` *and* a right-censored observation of weight `C2`, say --
#' and [hazard()] carries one status and one weight per row. A guard is
#' emitted for every pair of counts the job named, and only for named ones: a
#' *derived* `C2` fires on exactly the rows where no other count does, so it
#' cannot collide. Any job carrying a guard has its status hoisted into its
#' own chunk, so the guard runs, and is seen to run, before the fit.
#'
#' `hazard()`'s `time_lower` carries a different meaning per row, selected by
#' `status` (see `R/hazard_api.R`): for status 2 (interval) it is the
#' interval's lower bound (`CTIME`), but for status 0/1 it is the
#' counting-process *entry time* (default `0`), not a censoring bound. `TIME`
#' is always the interval's upper bound, and that is exactly what
#' `hazard()`'s `time_upper` already defaults to when left `NULL` -- so
#' `time_upper` is never emitted by this translator; passing it would be
#' redundant, and omitting it cannot drift out of sync with `TIME`.
#' `time_lower` is therefore built as one of, depending on which statements
#' are present:
#' * `ICENSOR` only: `ifelse(status == 2, CTIME, 0)` (`0` is `hazard()`'s
#'   documented default entry time for status 0/1 rows).
#' * `LCENSOR` only: the `LCENSOR` variable directly -- it applies to every
#'   row, not just interval ones, so no `ifelse()` gating is needed.
#' * Neither: `time_lower` is omitted (`NULL`).
#'
#' **`LCENSOR` and `ICENSOR` together are refused, not translated.** There is
#' no expression that serves: `time_lower` is one column carrying two
#' meanings, so gating it on status hands the interval rows their lower bound
#' and thereby drops their entry time, fitting a left-truncated
#' interval-censored subject as at risk from time `0`. That converges and
#' reports plausibly -- the exact failure mode this package exists to refuse.
#' The reference implementation carries three distinct times (`TIME`, `CTIME`,
#' `STIME`) and subtracts `H(STIME)` for every row, interval rows included, so
#' translating it faithfully needs an entry-time argument [hazard()] does not
#' have. It is also rare: 0 of the 93 `PROC HAZARD` jobs across the production
#' studies use the combination. So the pair is recorded in `untranslated` and
#' `refused` is set, and the caller emits a `stop()` in place of the fit.
#'
#' The `time_lower` `ifelse()` is gated on a `status_name` placeholder
#' (`.hzr_status`) the caller assigns the `status_expr` to first -- never
#' unconditionally, which would trip `hazard()`'s finite-value check off the
#' interval subset and, where populated, silently redefine event/right-censored
#' rows' risk-set entry times. `weights_expr` gates on the count variables
#' themselves, not on `status`, so it stays valid on the un-hoisted paths.
#'
#' @param statements Named list of SAS statement operands, e.g.
#'   `list(EVENT = "DEAD", TIME = "T", ICENSOR = c("C3", "CTIME"))`.
#'   `ICENSOR` carries two operands (event-count variable, interval
#'   lower-bound time variable); `LCENSOR` and `RCENSOR` carry one. `EVENT`
#'   may be absent if `ICENSOR` is present.
#' @return `list(status_expr = <call>, status_name = <name|NULL>,
#'   time_lower = <call|NULL>, weights_expr = <call|NULL>,
#'   untranslated = <data.frame>, refused = <logical>)`. `status_expr` is
#'   a `bquote()`-built call, evaluable against an environment/list holding
#'   the named SAS variables. `time_lower` and `weights_expr`, when
#'   non-`NULL`, are `bquote()`-built calls; `status_name` is non-`NULL` on
#'   every non-refused path, because every such job names at least one count
#'   and every named count carries a missing/negative guard that has to run in
#'   its own chunk ahead of the fit.
#'   `weights_expr` is non-`NULL` on every non-refused path, because
#'   `EVENT` and `ICENSOR` are both counts and one of the two is always
#'   present. `refused` is `TRUE` only for the `LCENSOR` +
#'   `ICENSOR` combination described above, and every other element is `NULL`
#'   when it is: there is nothing to emit. Both returns carry the same element
#'   names, so a caller reading one never meets an unexpected missing field.

#' Translate a SELECTION statement to hzr_stepwise() arguments.
#'
#' `hazard_y.y`'s `stepwisestmt` production is `STEPWISE stepwiseopts { setopt(33); }`,
#' and `stepwiseopts` can be empty -- the *statement* is what turns stepwise
#' on, not any particular direction keyword. So a bare `SELECTION;` (or one
#' carrying only `SLENTRY`/`SLSTAY`) legitimately enables stepwise; the
#' direction keywords only refine it. `ONEWAY` (aliases `NOSTEPWISE`/`NOSW`,
#' option 34) is the one option that turns stepwise back off.
#'
#' HAZARD's lexer also collapses FORWARD, FW, SW, SELECT and STEPWISE into
#' one token, which `hazard_y.y` maps to option 21; BACKWARD is option 22.
#' Option 21 is therefore two-way, so FORWARD maps to `direction = "both"`,
#' not `"forward"`. Mapping it to `"forward"` would silently change the
#' search on every stepwise job.
#'
#' Operands are resolved in `STEP` lexer context, matching HAZARD's own
#' `BEGIN STEP` start condition once inside a `SELECTION` statement. `SELECT`
#' is the one spelling that only resolves in `STMT` context (it is also an
#' alias for the statement keyword itself), so a `STEP`-context miss falls
#' back to `STMT` before being recorded as untranslated.
#'
#' When `ONEWAY`/`NOSTEPWISE`/`NOSW` disables stepwise, any `SLENTRY`/
#' `SLSTAY` also given are meaningless (there is no entry/stay search to
#' apply them to) and are moved into `untranslated` rather than silently
#' dropped -- discarding a parsed value with nothing recorded is exactly
#' the defect this package guards against.

#' Parse a PROC HAZPRED block into predict() call(s).
#'

#' `_HAZARD`/`_CLLHAZ`/`_CLUHAZ`, so it maps to `predict()` call(s) with
#' `se.fit`.
#'
#' `conf.type = "logit"` is set on the survival call, because SAS HAZPRED's
#' survival confidence limits are on the logit scale (`hzp_calc_srv_CL.c`),
#' while `predict.hazard()` defaults to `"log-log"` (the survfit standard).
#' Emitting the default would produce bounds that silently disagree with the
#' job being reproduced. The hazard call sets nothing: hazard limits are on
#' the log scale in both engines, so the default already agrees.
#'
#' `txt` is the whole normalised source, because HAZPRED's real input is the
#' `DATA=` prediction grid built by a preceding DATA step, not anything in
#' the PROC block itself. A grid that cannot be translated (`.hzr_parse_grid()`
#' returns `NULL`) is always recorded in `untranslated` here: a `predict()`
#' with no `newdata` is a hollow result, not "no grid needed".
